## Hi hi, I'm Reinald ðŸ‘‹


**Junior Web Developer | Python Enthusiast**

I enjoy building small, practical projects and experimenting with code in my free time. Most of what you'll find here are tools I've made for personal use. Things like automating tasks, fetching live data, or organizing files. Every repo is part of my learning journey.

## Some Projects
- [Weather App](https://github.com/reinald-claudio/simple-weather-app) - fetches live weather data by city using an open-source API.
- [File Manager (CLI)](https://github.com/reinald-claudio/file-organizer) - organizes files into tidy folders from the command line.
- [Gmail to Discord Notifier](https://github.com/Reinald-Claudio/Gmail-to-Discord-Notifier) - A personal Python tool that syncs my unread Gmails into my Discord channel using webhooks.
- Password Manager *(coming soon)*
