## Hi hi, I'm Reinald ðŸ‘‹


**Junior Web Developer | Python Enthusiast**

I enjoy building small, practical projects and experimenting with code in my free time. Most of what you'll find here are tools I've made for personal use. Things like automating tasks, fetching live data, or organizing files. Every repo is part of my learning journey.

## Some Projects
- [Password Vault (CLI)](https://github.com/Reinald-Claudio/Password-Vault-CLI-) - A command-line Password Vault built in Python using Fernet encryption and JSON data storage.
- [Gmail to Discord Notifier](https://github.com/Reinald-Claudio/Gmail-to-Discord-Notifier) - A personal Python tool that syncs my unread Gmails into my Discord channel using webhooks.
- [File Manager (CLI)](https://github.com/reinald-claudio/file-organizer) - organizes files into tidy folders from the command line.
